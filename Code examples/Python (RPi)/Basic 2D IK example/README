= Updates =

== 2018-03-12 - Speed control added to the example ==

Various small modifications to the code. The mains points are as follows:
1) (minor)    Added speed control to the example code. You can now specify a default speed for each servomotor channel individually.
2) (minor)    Fixed code to now accept floats for X/Y target. Allows for better control of end effector position.
3) (minor)    Fixed code to return only integet pulse values. Otherwise, it may return floats, which the SSC-32U ignore, along with the S parameter!
4) (trivial)  Changed code to use the last position (X or Y) if enter is pressed with no value given.
5) (trivial)  Added basic info at the top of the library file that had been forgotten.
